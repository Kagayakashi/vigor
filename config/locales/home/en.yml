# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  home:
    events: "Events"
    vigor: "Vigor"
    vigor_def: "<strong>Vigor</strong> in translation from Latin means “vital force”, “vital energy”."
    hello: "Welcome!"
    vigor_about_1: "Welcome to “<strong>Vigor</strong>” — the Latvian society for stroke
      survivors, their relatives and simply kind, compassionate people who are happy to
      give the necessary psychological support."
    vigor_about_2: "We are glad that you have got onto our web site and we hope that posted
      information could be useful to everyone who was faced with stroke."
    vigor_about_3: "On our site you will find information about stroke, free rehabilitation
      programmes, our society has to offer, and also materials on recovery opportunities
      after having a stroke."
    vigor_about_4: "We believe that our programs do help to understand psychological consequence
      of a stroke, to overcome it and to gain back the feeling of life’s exuberance and joy of
      being engaged into social life."
